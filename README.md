# bubble-tokenfield

Bubble tokenfield will be designed to support single instance for many tokenfields. Apply on parent level once, use it on children level everywhere. Children level is bindings free level, just add/remove html without even thinking about memory leaks. If you are a big data scrolling fan, you should like it!
